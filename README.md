# pages-test

Microblogging is cool, 
Twitter is not cool,
Making your own tools is cool,
Github Pages is cool 
But...its only static????
IDEA! -> Make a fake "server" side on your end that updates github pages so that you can micro blog!!

This is only a test to get used to pages and test out some features.
